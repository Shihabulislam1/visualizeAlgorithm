## Overview
Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that helps users understand various sorting and searching algorithms through interactive visualizations. The project aims to make complex algorithms more accessible and comprehensible by providing step-by-step visual representations of their execution.

## Features
- Visualization of Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and more.
- Visualization of Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, and more.
- Interactive user interface to generate random data and set sorting/searching speed.
- Sound effects for a more engaging experience.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) for data visualization


## How to Use
1. Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu (Sorting Algorithms or Searching Algorithms).
2. If selecting a sorting algorithm, click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
3. If selecting a searching algorithm, enter the target value in the input field and click the "Search" button to start the visualization.
4. Use the slider to adjust the visualization speed.
5. Click the "Generate Random Data" button to create a new set of random data for sorting algorithms.
